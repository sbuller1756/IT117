<main><p>Spicy and Icy started in 2000. We are family owned. My mother, Myrtle Boudreaux, started the restaurant. She is a true Cajun born and raised in Louisiana. The original menu came from her personal recipes. The restaurant started small at only 500 square feet. Over time we were able to expand</p><p>In 2017 I took over ownership. I am her son, Stephen. We are proud to have modernized the restaurant while keeping all the traditional Cajun dishes my mom started. The restaurant now features a pristine 2000 square foot dining room and 500 square foot wrap around bar. Every dish is prepared with an extra twist of spice by our professional chef. We also have an in-house mixologist, so every drink has a unique concoction.</p><p>Our mission is to provide the highest level of service while serving fresh quality food and featuring refreshing drinks. Here at Spicy and Icy customers are our focus. The staff’s priority is to make sure you have a top-notch experience. The restaurant’s relaxing, fun atmosphere will add to your dining experience.
