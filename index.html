<main><p>Welcome to Spicy and Icy. We are a modern restaurant specializing in spicy Cajun cuisine. Come enjoy authentic dishes like gumbo, etouffee, jambalaya and boudin. Our food is prepared to the highest quality using the freshest ingredients. Every dish is prepared and served with a twist of spice.</p><p>Be sure to cool off from the spice with our array of refreshing frozen drinks. These icy concoctions offer a great contrast to our spicy food. We have everything from Margaritas to Daiquiris and feature a frozen Hurricane. Each drink has been prepared by our in-house mixologist.</p><p>In addition to our food and drinks we hope you enjoy our laid-back southern hospitality. Our goal is to provide you a one of a kind experience with first class service. Bring yourself and your friends and come join us today! As they say in New Orleans, laissez les bon temps rouler (let the good times roll)!</p></main>
